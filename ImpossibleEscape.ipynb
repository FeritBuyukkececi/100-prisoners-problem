    "- There are 100 prisoners in the prison\n",
    "- In a room with 100 boxes, each box has a slip with a number between 1 and 100\n",
    "- Each prisoner with a number between 1 and 100 goes into the room, opens a box and reads the slip. \n",
    "    - If the number on the slip is the prisoner's number, prisoner wins the round. Then all boxes are closed (but not shuffled!)\n",
    "    - If the number doesn't match, prisoner can open another box. Each prisoner can try 50 boxes.\n",
    "    - If the prisoner cannot find a match in 50 boxes, he/she fails the round.\n",
    "- If they all succeed, they can all leave; but if one fails, they all lose!\n",

    "One specific rule of the game gives the greatest clue: All prisoners have to succeed or they all fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Veritasium explains this in great detail, but allow me as well: Let's say a prisoner 8 enters the room and applies the 'smart' strategy as follows:\n",
    "1. Opens the 8th box and reads 52 on the slip\n",
    "2. Opens the 52nd box and reads 78 on the slip\n",
    "3. Opens the 78th box and reads 8 on the slip: The prisoner just succeeded!\n",
    "\n",
    "So prisoner 8 opened boxes 8,52,78 respectively. Now, imagine the case: If prisoner 78 enters the room and follows the same strategy, he/she would open boxes 78,8,52. Same goes for prisoner 52 as he/she would follow 52,78,8 as well. That means boxes 8, 52 and 78 form a loop and since this loop is shorter than 50 elements, these 3 prisoners succeed with this strategy. If a prisoner, say prisoner 34 is in a loop > 50 elements, he/she will fail and make everyone else fail as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if boxes form loops where one of them have more than 50 elements, the smart strategy will fail. The probability of forming a loop of 100 elements is 1/100 (100!/100)/100!, a loop of 99 elements is 1/99 and so on. Therefore the proability of boxes forming a loop with greater than 50 elements is 1/50 + 1/51 + ... + 1/99 and 1/100."
